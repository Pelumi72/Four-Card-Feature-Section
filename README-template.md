## My process
I started by the structuring the website using HTML. Then I used CSS and bootstrap to style the website. I also used google fonts to give the preferred font family, weight and size.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I learnt a lot while developing this site. It was a little challenging but I had to learn to work with CSS grids to complete this project. I also came to the realization that I have to start using mobile-first-view.

### Continued development

I would like to learn how to use bootstrap grid properly.

### Useful resources

- [Basic Concept of Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout) - This article gave me an elaborate explanation of CSS grid. It also helped me see what I was doing wrong.
